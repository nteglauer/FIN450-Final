Framing the problem:

How do we reduce overall homelessness in North America:

1. Predict something interesting:

Homelessness: Data from the past x number of years, levels for different areas (USA, & Canada).
We analyze that data with underlying influence during those periods (weather, lunar, economic data, come up with more weird shit that could impact homelessness, 
Which areas have the highest levels of homelessness
What do these areas have in common?


2. Use this prediction to come up with a solution to a problem:

Given our analysis on the past data (regressions, ML stuff..)
2 types of analysis from class that we learned
2 types of analysis that we have found independently

3. Conclusion:

Prevention: being able to predict the factors that contribute the most to homelessness.
What actions are you going to take to address these factors?
What steps can society / government take to reduce the homeless population?



Finding Data Sources (identify static vs dynamic):

Homelessness data
Underlying factors data (API’s and csv, 
Weather
Lunar
Economic
Others….
Can we web scrape from http://maps.sasaki.com/visualizations/homelessness/
